        <p>I'm an aquariaus and I grew up on the east end of long island in the village of Sag Harbor. It was like mentioned in Moby Dick a couple of times. Also I'm Brazilian but don't ask me about the World Cup beause I do not know anything about soccer other than Pel√© is from my city. 
        <p>Before I moved to NYC for undergrad at NYU Stern, I split my time between World of Warcraft and jumping horses - equitation eowww. I went to an arts highschool were I did some coding, but my "mediums", we were all pretentious young artists, were analog photography (duh) and mixed media.</p>
        <p>While in college I got degrees in finance and art, was on the eboard of my fraternity and of Stern's international committee. After graduating I worked in structuring and securitizations for 2 years. It was really boring and the hours sucked X_x Currently I am working for an accounting software firm which is cool and a great conversation starter at bars. I basically help lead both products and development teams on implementations for Enterprise Level clients. I am enjoying this new job much more, however I would like to move into a career where I can apply my design $killz. In my free time I like to go to museums, travel to iconic exotic locations for content and sip on vodka sodas at the beach.</p>
